# Notes
**Day 4**: A nice change of pace from day 3. I don't know how this lottery company is going to print 14 million tickets for one person. Finals week is coming soon, so i'll probably get behind.

**Day 3**: I spent more time than I should have refactoring my solution after the second part, but ended up with something that works well enough. I started with scanning numbers first and then looking for symbols, and changed my solution to scanning for symbols and then looking for numbers.

**Day 2**: Nothing too difficult. I wish I knew how to use regex properly, but I know how to split strings though!

**Day 1**:The first part was fine, but hit a roadblock with the second. The prompt wasn't clear on cases with shared letters between spelled-out numbers (threeight) I found a *small* hint online that led me to a solution that worked.
